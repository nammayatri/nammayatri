This is a temporary location for the utility we use to modify out DEV deployment scripts.

This utility is a temporary solution to the following problem:
To deploy our development we shall populate the SQL tables with some initial data, partially encrypted.
But, since the `passetto` encryption service keys DB isn't yet initialized, we can't do this.

The first proposed soution looks like this:
1. Tell the `passetto` service's container wait for keys DB being created, then run keys DB initialization utility, then start the `passetto` service proper;
2. For each app create the utility, which runs **before** the app (e.g. `rider-app` and `beckn-transport`), talks to running `passetto` service, encrypts
   some initial data, and populates the `app-backend`'s tables with them;
3. Run `rider-app` after.

This solution is problematic in the sence everything shall be synchronized. We shall run 1 first, wait, then run 2, wait, then run 3.

Instead we do this: create standalone utility (`geninis`) using `passetto` *library* which allows us to *simultaneously* generate initial set of keys, *and encrypt* the relevant data with these keys.

Then add generated data to deployment scripts both for `passetto` and apps (e.g. `rider-app` and `beckn-transport`) databases. Now everything starts with already existing (and coherent) data.

For convenience, the utility also uses `beckn` library to also create hashed counterparts of encrypted data (we need both in our current design), such that everything is centralyzed.

If thу approach proves to be viable, we shall refine and improve the idea and overhaul the deployment infrastructure.
