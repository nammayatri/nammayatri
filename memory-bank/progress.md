# Progress

_This document tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## Current Status (as of Initial Analysis)
- **Core Infrastructure**: The foundational elements (Nix build, Haskell backend, Purescript frontend, key service integrations like Beckn, OSRM, AWS) seem to be defined in `flake.nix`.
- **Service Skeleton**: A modular structure for various services (rider, provider, payment, safety, etc.) is in place.
- **Memory Bank**: Initial setup and population with high-level information is complete. Task 'initialize memory-bank for this repo' confirmed this state.

## What Works (Assumed based on setup)
- The Nix environment can likely build the project components.
- Core dependencies are integrated.

## What's Left to Build/Analyze for Memory Bank
- Detailed understanding of the functionality and APIs of each microservice/library in `Backend/app/` and `Backend/lib/`.
- Specific data models used by services.
- Interactions and data flow between services.
- Frontend component details and their linkage to backend services.
- Deployment strategies and operational aspects (if discoverable from code/config).

## Known Issues (from Memory Bank perspective)
- The current Memory Bank content is high-level and requires significant detail to be added from deeper codebase analysis.

_This document should be updated regularly as the project evolves and features are developed/analyzed._
