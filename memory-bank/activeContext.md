# Active Context

_This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, preferences, learnings, and project insights._

## Current Focus (as of Initial Analysis)
- Understanding the overall architecture and services of the NammaYatri platform.
- Populating the initial Memory Bank based on codebase structure and key configuration files.

## Recent Changes
- Cline Memory Bank initialized.
- Initial population of `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` based on high-level analysis.
- Task 'initialize memory-bank for this repo' completed: Core memory bank files confirmed to exist and contain substantial baseline information.

## Next Steps (for Memory Bank)
- Deeper analysis of individual service directories within `Backend/app/` and `Backend/lib/`.
- Identification of key functionalities, APIs, and data models for major services.
- Refinement of all memory bank documents with more specific details.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Prioritizing breadth of understanding across key services before deep-diving into every file.

_This document should be updated regularly as development progresses._
