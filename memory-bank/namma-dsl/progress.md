# Progress: Namma DSL

## What Works
- The Namma DSL provides a robust framework for defining API and Storage schemas in YAML.
- It successfully generates Haskell boilerplate code for API interfaces (using Servant) and database interactions (using Beam).
- The DSL supports a hybrid development model, allowing seamless integration with hand-written Haskell code.
- Mechanisms like `imports`, `beamFields`, `toTType`/`fromTType`, `intermediateTransformers`, and `EXTRA_QUERY_FILE` enable flexible customization and extension.
- Dedicated transformer modules (e.g., `Storage.Queries.Transformers.Person.hs`) are effectively used for data manipulation and enrichment.
- ACL (Access Control Layer) transformers (e.g., `Beckn.ACL.FRFS.*`) are used to construct external API payloads.
- The generated code integrates well with manual business logic orchestration (e.g., `ExternalBPP.Flow.hs`) and external API calling mechanisms (e.g., `ExternalBPP.CallAPI.hs`).

## What's Left to Build
- Continuous improvement of the DSL's expressiveness and features based on evolving project requirements.
- Further optimization of the code generation process for performance and efficiency.
- Expansion of documentation and examples for developers using the DSL.

## Current Status
- The Namma DSL is a mature and actively used component in the NammaYatri platform.
- Its capabilities for API and Storage code generation, along with hybrid support, are well-understood and documented.

## Current Project In Focus
- Documenting the Namma DSL itself.

## Known Issues
- None identified during this deep dive.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to adopt a DSL for API and Storage layers has proven effective in standardizing development and reducing boilerplate.
- The hybrid approach, combining code generation with manual Haskell code, has provided the necessary flexibility for complex domain logic and external integrations.
