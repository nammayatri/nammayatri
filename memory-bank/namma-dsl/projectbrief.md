# Project Brief: Namma DSL

## Project Goals
- To provide a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for defining API interfaces and database schemas.
- To automate the generation of Haskell boilerplate code for API clients/servers and database interactions.
- To ensure consistency and reduce manual errors in API and storage layer development.
- To support a hybrid development model, allowing seamless integration of generated code with custom, hand-written Haskell logic.

## Core Requirements
- Define API endpoints, request/response types, and authentication mechanisms.
- Define database tables, fields, and relationships.
- Support complex type mappings and transformations between Haskell domain types and database representations.
- Enable extension of generated code with custom queries, API logic, and data transformers.
