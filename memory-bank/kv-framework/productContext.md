# Product Context: KV Framework

The KV framework addresses critical product requirements related to data performance, scalability, and analytics.

**Problems Solved:**
- **High Latency for Transactional Operations:** By using Redis as an immediate KV store, the framework significantly reduces latency for read and write operations, crucial for real-time transactional workflows.
- **Database Overload:** Asynchronous persistence to the main relational database prevents it from being overwhelmed during peak traffic, ensuring system stability and responsiveness.
- **Complex Analytical Queries:** Offloading analytical workloads to ClickHouse via Kafka streams ensures that complex reporting and historical data analysis do not impact the performance of the operational database.

**How it Should Work:**
- Applications interact with a unified KV interface (e.g., `createWithKV`, `findOneWithKV`).
- Data is immediately available in Redis after write operations.
- Data eventually persists to the main database without blocking application threads.
- All transactional data changes are available for real-time and historical analysis.

**User Experience Goals (Indirect):**
- Faster response times for user-facing features that rely on transactional data.
- Improved system reliability and availability due to reduced database load.
- Richer analytical insights for business intelligence and decision-making.
