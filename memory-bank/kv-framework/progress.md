# Progress: KV Framework

This document tracks the progress and current status of the KV framework documentation.

## What Works

-   A comprehensive understanding of the KV framework's architecture, including Redis as the immediate transactional store, Redis Streams, the Drainer Service, Kafka, and ClickHouse.
-   Clear identification of Primary and Secondary Key concepts and their implementation in code.
-   Detailed analysis of KV query patterns (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) and their corresponding high-level functions in the `Storage.Queries` modules.
-   Documentation of the overall data flow, distinguishing between synchronous and asynchronous operations.

## What's Left to Build

-   The core documentation for the KV framework has been established. Further details could include:
    -   Specific Redis configurations.
    -   Error handling strategies within the KV operations.
    -   Monitoring and alerting for the KV components.
    -   Performance benchmarks.

## Current Status

-   The KV framework's core concepts and implementation details are well-documented in the `memory-bank/kv-framework` directory.
-   The documentation provides a solid foundation for understanding this critical system component.

## Known Issues

-   None identified during the documentation process.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Initial confusion regarding Redis's role (cache vs. transactional store) was clarified through user feedback and code analysis, leading to a more accurate representation of the KV framework.
