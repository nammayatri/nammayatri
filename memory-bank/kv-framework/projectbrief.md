# Project Brief: KV Framework

This document outlines the core aspects of the KV (Key-Value) framework used in the system. The framework leverages Redis as a high-performance, immediate transactional data store, complemented by asynchronous mechanisms for persistence to a relational database and streaming to Kafka for analytical processing.

**Core Goals:**
- Provide low-latency read/write operations for transactional data.
- Ensure eventual consistency between Redis and the main relational database.
- Enable robust and scalable analytics through data streaming to ClickHouse.
- Abstract underlying data storage complexities from the application layer.
